# vaccum-cleaner
This is a Python project implementing a simple reflex agent and a table-driven agent for a vacuum cleaner in a 10x10 grid environment. The agents navigate the grid, avoiding walls and cleaning dirt while minimizing penalties.  The implementation includes functions for movement, dirt cleaning, and penalty tracking.
